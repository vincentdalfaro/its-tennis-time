        "summary": "Perched atop George Sterling Park, the Alice Marble Tennis Courts offer sweeping views of San Francisco, with the iconic cable car passing along nearby Lombard Street. The location is undeniably scenic, but the playing conditions leave much to be desired. The courts suffer from high winds due to their elevation and lack of wind screens, making them borderline unplayable at times. Additionally, the surrounding park lacks basic amenities—there’s no bathroom or playground in the vicinity, a rarity among San Francisco parks. One redeeming feature is the court’s dedicated ball wall, a unique and increasingly rare amenity in the city."

Conveniently located near BART and several bus lines, Balboa Park’s greatest strength is its availability—thanks to its distance from the city center, court reservations are often easy to come by. While the courts are in fairly good shape, the park lacks any standout features or unique amenities to distinguish it from other reservable locations in San Francisco."

However, much like the Alice Marble courts, the amenities leave much to be desired. The park lacks restrooms, a playground, and benches, and its steep hillside location poses accessibility challenges for those with mobility needs. That said, the courts provide a unique, secluded atmosphere and are conveniently located near several key bus lines."

The courts are accompanied by a basketball court, small soccer field, playground, and spectator stands. Just a short walk away, you'll also find restrooms and a lawn bowling area. The park offers frequent court availability and a comfortable, spacious environment for players and visitors alike."

The park offers three reservable courts and three walk-up courts, all in excellent condition and equipped with lights for night play. Centrally located between the Castro and Mission Districts, the park is easily accessible via several nearby bus lines. The courts are split into two sets of three, each with high surrounding walls that can double as makeshift hitting walls. Overall, these courts are among the best in the city and provide high-quality play for both locals and visitors alike."

Unlike many mixed-use parks in San Francisco, DuPont is exclusively for tennis, which keeps the space focused and free of distractions. A major convenience is the on-site restroom located right next to the courts—something many other parks lack. The surrounding area also offers easy street parking, and the high walls around the courts help keep play uninterrupted. Overall, it's a reliable and well-equipped spot for players of all levels."

While the court is of adequate quality, what sets the location apart is its well-rounded amenities: a nearby basketball court, an adjacent playground, and generally easy street parking. It’s a solid neighborhood spot that balances accessibility with a bit of variety for families and multi-sport visitors."

The two courts are fully enclosed, equipped with floodlights for night play, and feature a well-maintained surface. Thanks to both their canyon location and the presence of wind screens, players are shielded from the often-unpredictable San Francisco wind—making for a more consistent playing experience. While there is all-day parking nearby, public transit access is limited, with the 44 bus being the only adjacent line. Overall, it's a reliable and thoughtfully designed spot tucked into one of the city's more unique natural settings."

While the court surface is somewhat weathered, the presence of floodlights extends play into the evening, and the nearby recreation center—featuring a pool, playground, and well-maintained restrooms—adds strong support amenities. Uniquely, the adjoining parking is both timed and paid, making Hamilton one of the few parks in the city with stricter car access. Fortunately, the area is highly transit-friendly, making public transportation the preferred way to get there."

It’s situated on Broadway Street—a busy thoroughfare with limited, paid parking, which can be inconvenient. However, a silver lining is that reservations are often available on a daily basis. While the court itself could use some maintenance, the surrounding amenities—including a well-maintained and fenced-in playground—help make the park a more attractive option overall."

With ivy and greenery climbing many of the walls and a nearby playground, it has a quiet, tucked-away feel. That said, as a place to actually play tennis, it can be somewhat forgettable. The restrooms are fairly standard, but it’s worth noting that the women’s bathroom is the only one among the city’s tennis courts that isn’t ADA accessible."

The facility includes one reservable court and two walk-up courts, all with lights for evening play and a high-quality surface. Amenities include nearby bus lines and two-hour parking, making it accessible for most players. Overall, the courts combine reliable amenities with the distinct charm found in many of San Francisco’s best tennis parks."

All three courts are reservable, which is a bonus for those planning ahead. Surrounded by tall pine trees, the setting offers some wind protection while still opening up views of the city beyond. The courts are positioned side by side, which can feel a bit tight during busy times, but the overall setting—including a playground and basketball court nearby—makes this a well-rounded location."

While the courts themselves are pretty standard, they are in incredible condition and well maintained. In addition, the park itself is conveniently centered among five different bus lines: 1, 12, 24, 27, 49, making it the most accessible park in the city. The beautiful Lafayette park also offers a plethora of different amenities: a dog park, good parking, and a playground a short walk away."

That makes it a solid last-minute option, both for the volume of available courts and the ease of parking. However, the courts themselves fall short in a few key areas: the surface quality is subpar, and there's no bathroom on-site—an essential amenity that's noticeably absent. While the courts lack nearby facilities, McLaren still holds value as a reliable backup due to its availability and convenience."

The playing surfaces are in solid condition, but the courts don’t offer much beyond the basics. Due to their elevated location and the lack of wind screens, they can get particularly windy—something to keep in mind when planning a match. While functional and well-maintained, the courts are fairly unremarkable compared to other options in the city."

Elevated retaining walls on two sides of the court serve as makeshift ball walls while also taking advantage of San Francisco’s natural topography—offering a unique top-down view from the playground above. Though somewhat secluded, the court provides a peaceful playing environment. With limited public transit access (only the 36 line services the area), this spot is best suited for nearby residents looking for a convenient and quiet game."

Still, the well-maintained court surfaces, along with convenient amenities like a nearby bathroom and playground, make this park a scenic and worthwhile place to play."
